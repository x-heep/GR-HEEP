# eXtending X-HEEP

X-HEEP is meant to be extended with your own custom IPs. X-HEEP itself posseses a hardware-software framework capable of working standalone. If you want to extend it, you will need to merge your hardware and software with X-HEEP's.

For this purpose we support the [CV-X-IF](https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/openhw-group-core-v-xif/en/latest/intro.html) interface with the [cv32e40px](https://github.com/x-heep/cv32e40px) or [cv32e40x](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40x) or [cv32e20](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cve2) RISC-V CPUs, and we expose master and slave ports to/from the bus.

> We recommend using the cv32e40px for pairing with your CV-X-IF compliant coprocessor. If you choose to use the cv32e40x, X-HEEP currently uses the revision [`0.9.0`](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40x/commit/f17028f2369373d9443e4636f2826218e8d54e0f). It is recommended to use the same revision in peripheral IPs to prevent conflicts during RTL compilation. While the cv32e20 does not support custom memory instructions.

In addition, the X-HEEP testbench has been extended with a DMA, dummy peripherals (including the flash), and two CV-X-IF compatible coprocessor: one implementing the RV32F RISC-V extension and one implementing custom matrix extensions.
This has been done to help us maintaining and verifying the extension interface.

If you want to try the FPU-like coprocessor with a CV-X-IF compatible CPU as the cv32e40px, you can do it in the base X-HEEP as follows:

```
make mcu-gen CPU=cv32e40px
make verilator-build FUSESOC_PARAM="--X_EXT=1"
make app PROJECT=example_matfadd ARCH=rv32imfc
make verilator-run
```

The program should terminate with value 0.

Also, you can try the FPU-like coprocessor with a CV-X-IF extended cve2 using the Zfinx extensions (i.e. the Floating-Point register-file is actually the same as the General-Purpose register-file).
The reason why you cannot use the RVF without ZFinx is that the cv32e20 core X-IF does not support memory X-operations.

First, you need the OpenHW Group CORE-V Compiler, then:

```
make mcu-gen
make verilator-build FUSESOC_PARAM="--X_EXT=1 --ZFINX=1"
make app PROJECT=example_matfadd COMPILER_PREFIX=riscv32-corev- ARCH=rv32imc_zicsr_zifencei_zfinx
make verilator-run
```

If you want to try [Quadrilatero](https://github.com/pulp-platform/quadrilatero), the custom matrix ISA extensions, you can use any of the cores as the co-processor has its own load/store unit.

First, install the compiler as written [here](https://github.com/esl-epfl/xheep_matrix_spec/blob/main/BUILDING.md), then, configure X-HEEP to have:

```
    bus_type: "NtoM"
    ram_banks: {
        code_and_data: {
            num: 3
            sizes: [32]
        }
        data_interleaved: {
            auto_section: auto
            // the name is used by example_matadd_interleaved as .xheep_data_interleaved
            type: interleaved
            num: 4
            size: 16
        }
    }

    linker_sections:
    [
        {
            name: code
            start: 0
            #minimum size for freeRTOS and clang
            size: 0x00000F800
        }
        {
            name: data
            start: 0x00000F800
        }
    ]
```


```
make mcu-gen (make sure you pass the configuration file set above)
make verilator-build FUSESOC_PARAM="--X_EXT=1 --QUADRILATERO=1"
make app PROJECT=example_matmul_quadrilatero ARCH=rv32imc_zicsr_xtheadmatrix0p1 COMPILER_FLAGS=-menable-experimental-extensions COMPILER=clang CLANG_LINKER_USE_LD=1
make verilator-run
```
